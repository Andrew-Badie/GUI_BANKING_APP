## Introduction

The Bank Application is a GUI-based Java application developed using JavaFX. It provides functionalities for creating customer accounts, performing banking operations (deposit, withdraw, check balance), and managing customers through a simple interface. This project showcases skills in Java programming, file handling, and GUI design with JavaFX.

## Features

Login System: Supports login for both customers and managers with role-based access.
Account Creation: Managers can add new customer accounts by providing a username and password.
Deposit and Withdraw: Customers can deposit money into their accounts or withdraw funds, provided they meet the requirements.
Purchase: Allows customers to make purchases, updating their account balance accordingly.
Check Balance: Customers can view their current account balance.
Account Deletion: Managers can delete customer accounts.
Logout Functionality: Provides a confirmation alert for logging out.
Error Handling: Displays error messages for invalid input or incorrect actions (e.g., incorrect username or password).
## Technologies Used

Java: Core programming language for building the application.
JavaFX: For creating the graphical user interface.
File Handling: Uses Java's File, FileReader, FileWriter, and BufferedReader for reading and writing customer data to text files.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Implements principles of OOP for managing customer accounts.
## Installation
